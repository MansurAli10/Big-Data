# Big-Data

## Introduction
Before going deep into the topic let's generally understand what is big data. Huge amount of data which you cannot be processed using the traditional methods is known as Big Data.
'Big Data' refers to an immense and continually expanding collection of data. This data is exceptionally large in size and has been growing at an exponential rate over time. Typically, we are familiar to working with data in sizes ranging from megabytes (such as Word documents and Excel files) to gigabytes (like movies and software code). However, when data reaches the scale of petabytes, equivalent to 10^15 bytes, it is categorized as Big Data.
Almost 90% of the data which we have today has been generated within the last three years.

### Examples of Big Data
Certainly, here are simpler explanations of the examples of Big Data:
1) A single jet engine can produce over 10 terabytes of data in just 30 minutes of flying. With thousands of flights happening daily, this adds up to many petabytes of data.
2) Every day, Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn collect more than 500 terabytes of new data from users and add it to their databases.
3) Weather stations and satellites gather massive amounts of data that's used to predict the weather.
4) Big telecom companies like T-Mobile and Verizon collect and analyze data from millions of users to create and offer better mobile plans based on user behavior.

### Types of Big Data
Generally Big Data is Classified into three types
1) Structured Data
2) Unstructured Data
3) Semi-structured Data

**Structured Data**:
Structured data is information that comes in a consistent, organized format, making it easy to store, find, and work with. 
One common example of structured data is the kind you find in a relational database management system.
For instance, think of a table in a database that holds information about employees. This table is a straightforward example of structured data.

**Unstructured Data**:
Unstructured data is information that doesn't follow a specific pattern or structure. A common example of unstructured data is when you have a mix of different types of data, like text files, images, and videos all jumbled together.
For instance, think about what you get when you do a 'Google Search.' The results you get from a Google Search are a prime example of unstructured data.

**Semi-structured Data**:
Semi-structured data is a type of information that combines both structured and unstructured elements.
An example of semi-structured data is 
1) Data stored in an XML file.
2) Comma Separated Values(CSV) File

## 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (or) Characteristics of Big Data ##

1. Volume
2. Variety
3. Velocity
4. Veracity
5. Value

**Volume**:
The term "volume" refers to a large amount of data. The magnitude of data plays a critical role in determining its worth. When the
amount of data is extremely vast, it is referred to as 'Big Data'.
So, whether data is considered Big Data or not depends on how much of it there is. When handling Big Data, it's important to pay attention to its sheer size, or volume.
***Example:*** In 2016, worldwide mobile traffic was predicted to be 6.2 Exabytes (6.2 billion GB) per month. Furthermore, by 2020, we will have about 40000 ExaBytes of data
